# writing

I need to write. I've been telling myself I'm going to start writing for a very long time, but I always have an excuse.
The older I get, however, the lamer I think excuses are, and the harder it is to rationalise them.

I have a tendency to want things done to an excellent standard, like most of us I really struggle to release work when it's not
perfectly shiny and polished. This, I have realised, is really an excuse. I can't release work that _is_ nice and shiny and polished
unless I actually start that work.

With that in mind, this repo is born. It's simple: articles and posts written in Markdown, and in version control because I'm a developer
and version control is basically one of the fundamental pillars upholding my life at this point.

I do have plans to make public what I write here (those plans including writing my own static site generator), but they can come later when I have a body of work built up.

My GitHub profile has an email address if you'd like to get in touch and comment or disagree with anything I've said.
I'm happy to have a _civil_ discussion on just about anything. Spellchecking and grammatical errors also welcome.
